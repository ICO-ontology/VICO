### Vaccination Informed Consent Ontology (VICO)
VICO is an application ontology for vaccination/immunization informed consent built upon previously constructed ICO (Informed Consent Ontology) and VO (vaccine ontology). The goal of developing VICO is to organize vaccination informed consent-related entities and their relations to enable vaccination informed consent data standardization and integration. The current focus of VICO delevelopment is to represent different vaccination informed consent forms in such a way that it will support consistent representation of immunization questionnaires.
